# SavePoint - The Modern Game Collection Platform

SavePoint is a web-first app built to modernize how people collect and manage video games while also helping retro game stores to digitize their inventory, pricing, and storefronts.

I first envisioned SavePoint as a personal tool to track my own games. But after seeing how many retro stores still rely on outdated systems like spreadsheets or pen and paper, I realized there was a real need for something more modern. SavePoint aims to be that modern solution for both collectors and retro gaming businesses.

For collectors, SavePoint makes it effortless to scan, catalog, and value physical or digital games. For stores, it’s a way to modernize operations, sync with online marketplaces, and reach more customers.

### **🔍 Why SavePoint Matters**

Many retro game stores still rely on **spreadsheets**, **handwritten logs**, and **pricing stickers that quickly become outdated**, and many don’t have an online presence at all. Meanwhile, collectors lack **a unified platform** that combines **game tracking**, **price tracking**, **compatibility info**, and, critically, **local store inventories**.

SavePoint bridges that gap.
- For collectors, it makes it easy to scan barcodes, catalog physical and digital games, check market values via PriceCharting (and our own algorithm), track compatibility across platforms, and even view local store inventory and trade-in values.
- For stores, it simplifies inventory tracking, recommends pricing based on real-time data, and syncs their inventory with online marketplaces (eBay, Shopify, etc.), bringing local shops into the digital age.
